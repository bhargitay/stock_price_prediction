# Stock Price Prediciton
Suoltion to stock market prediction problem.

**problem description:** predict the daily closing price of US stocks using past 60 days 
of stock market data

## Datasets
I used three datasets for this project:

[US Stocks & ETFs - Tickers, Company Info, Logos](https://www.kaggle.com/marketahead/all-us-stocks-tickers-company-info-logos#companies.csv): 
a dataset of available US stock and ETF tickers with some other information.

[Huge Stock Market Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/borismarjanovic/price-volume-data-for-all-us-stocks-etfs/data): 
the full historical daily price and volume data for all US-based stocks and ETFs trading on the NYSE, NASDAQ, and 
NYSE MKT. It's one of the best datasets of its kind you can obtain.

[US Holiday Dates 2010-2020:](https://data.world/jennifer-v/us-holiday-dates-2010-2020)
To make my notebook work, you should first download the datasets mentioned above to your working directory into a separate 
folder called 'data'.
